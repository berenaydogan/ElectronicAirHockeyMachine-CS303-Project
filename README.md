This repository contains the term project we made as a team of two for CS303 Logic and System Design course at SabancÄ± University.  This project involves creating an electronic air hockey game for two players using Verilog and implementing it on an FPGA device. The game is played on a 5x5 grid, simulated with LEDs and seven-segment displays (SSDs) to show the puck's movement and the score. Players A and B take turns in controlling the puck's Y-coordinate and direction using switches and buttons. The puck moves across the grid, and players must hit it back to the opponent's side within a 2-second window per step. The game continues until one player scores three goals by making the opponent miss the puck.
